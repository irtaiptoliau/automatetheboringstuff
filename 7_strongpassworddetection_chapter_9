#Chapter 9
#Strong Password Detection
#Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. 
#A strong password has several rules: it must be at least eight characters long, contain both uppercase and lowercase characters, and have at least one digit.

#my solution below

import re

print("Password criteria:\n+ it must be at least eight characters long,\n+ contain both uppercase and lowercase characters,\n+ and have at least one digit.\n")
pattern = r'''
    (?=.*\d)
    (?=.*[a-z])
    (?=.*[A-Z])
    .{8,}
'''
x = input('Your password\n')
while not re.match(pattern, x, re.VERBOSE):
    x = input('Your password does not match the criteria. Please create another one.\n')
else:
    print('Your password has been accepted.')
