In 2025 I read the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart and did exercises from the book. In this folder you can find my solutions for the tasks from the book. 
Each file is a copy of a ".py" file I have on my computer that can be opened and run in IDLE, or in a similar program of your choice.
