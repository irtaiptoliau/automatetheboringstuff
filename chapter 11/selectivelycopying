#Chapter 11
#Selectively Copying
#Write a program that walks through a folder tree and searches for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg). Copy these files from their current location to a new folder.

#my solution below

import os, re, shutil, glob
from pathlib import Path
path = 'your/path/here'
l = input("Please write the file extention (without the dot), example: rtf/txt/doc:\n")
k = any(Path(path).glob("*." + l))
if k:
    foldername = input('The name for the new folder:\n')
    m = os.path.join(path,foldername)
    newfolder = os.mkdir(m)
    for filename in os.listdir(path):
        source = os.path.join(path, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(source) and source.endswith(l):
            x = shutil.copy(source, m)
    print('Done')
else:
    print(f"There are no {l} files in the folder {path}")
