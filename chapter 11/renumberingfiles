#Chapter 6
#Renumbering Files
#Write a program that finds all files with a given prefix in a single folder and locates any gaps in the numbering. 

#my solution below

import os, re
folder_path = 'path_to_folder'
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path):
    for file in files:
        for i in range(1, 100):
            k = os.path.join(folder_path, ("report" + str(i) + ".txt"))
            if os.path.exists(k):
                continue
            else:
                open(k, 'a').close() #creates empy file with the name to cover the gap
                print(k)
