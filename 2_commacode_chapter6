#Chapter 6
#Commacode
#Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and inserted before the last item. 

#my solution below

#words = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats', 'dogs', 'bats', 'bugs'] 
#words is a list

def commacode(words):
  for i in range(len(words)):
    if i < (len(words)-2):
      print (words[i] + ', ', end = '')
    if i == (len(words)-2):
      print (words[i] + ' and '+ words[i+1], end = '')
